# Skinnnn
A minimal about me application. [View on heroku](http://vast-reaches-2424.herokuapp.com/).

## Stuff to be done:

- add image upload
  this should work via drag n drop and regular file selection
  files should be checked for quality.
- make edit mode toggle-able
- make adding links work via the edit interface
- make sorting links possible

## Get it running locally
	# Install dependencies
	gem install bundler
	bundle install

	# Run local server
	ruby app.rb
